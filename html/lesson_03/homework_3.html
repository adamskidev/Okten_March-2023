  <h2> The Last of Us - Ep.1 "When You're Lost in the Darkness" </h2>
  <p>
    On a talk show in 1968, epidemiologists Newman (John Hannah) and Schoenheist (Christopher Heyerdahl) discuss the potential of a global pandemic. Newman suggests fungi are a grave threat given lack of preventative treatment or cure. Schoenheist points out the impossibility of fungal infection in humans due to fungi's inability to survive body heat. Newman agrees but notes fungi could evolve to overcome this weakness as the world gets warmer, at which point humanity would not survive.
    <br><br> In 2003, in Austin, Texas, 14-year-old Sarah (Nico Parker) is awoken in the middle of the night and discovers her neighbors attacked by a creature, a once-senile elderly woman. Sarah's father Joel (Pedro Pascal) returns with his brother Tommy (Gabriel Luna) and kills the creature. As Joel, Tommy, and Sarah flee through crowds, debris from a crashed airplane overturns Tommy's truck. Joel runs while carrying an injured Sarah but gets cornered by a soldier, who shoots at them. Tommy kills the soldier, but Sarah is fatally wounded and dies in Joel's arms.
    <br><br> Twenty years later, in 2023, after the global pandemic of the Cordyceps fungi destroyed human civilization, Joel lives in a military quarantine zone in Boston, Massachusetts, managed by the Federal Disaster Response Agency (FEDRA). He and his partner Tess (Anna Torv) smuggle and sell contraband. Joel plans to leave for Wyoming in search of Tommy, with whom he lost contact. Fourteen-year-old Ellie (Bella Ramsey) is held by the Fireflies, a resistance group against FEDRA. Their leader, Marlene (Merle Dandridge), reveals she placed Ellie into FEDRA military school as a child for her protection but now plans to transport her west.
    <br><br> Joel and Tess purchase a car battery from Robert (Brendan Fletcher) but get double-crossed when it is sold to the Fireflies. They find the deal has gone awry, leaving Robert and most Fireflies dead. Marlene begs Joel and Tess to take Ellie to the Massachusetts State House in exchange for supplies; they accept. The trio wait until nightfall to leave. They are caught by a soldier and forced to comply with an infection check. Ellie stabs the soldier in the leg. He threatens to shoot Ellie, reminding Joel of Sarah's death; he beats the soldier to death. Ellie's scan is positive, but she swears she is not infected since she was bitten weeks earlier. Joel, Tess, and Ellie enter a biological contamination area in Boston's commercial district to flee pursuing soldiers.

  <h2> The Last of Us - Ep.2 "Infected" </h2>
  <p>
    In 2003, authorities in Jakarta show Ratna Pertiwi (Christine Hakim), a mycology professor, a sample from a human, which she identifies as Ophiocordyceps. Lieutenant-General Agus Hidayat (Yayu A.W. Unru [id]) shows Ratna a corpse of a woman with a human bite mark on its leg and fungal growths in its mouth. He informs Ratna the woman was killed after biting her co-workers at a flour factory, while other co-workers are missing. Ratna remarks the location provides an excellent substrate for the fungus, adds there is no cure or vaccine for the infection, and recommends bombing the entire city to contain the outbreak.
    <br><br> In 2023, Joel (Pedro Pascal) and Tess (Anna Torv) hold Ellie (Bella Ramsey) at gunpoint and demand to know why they were tasked with escorting her. Ellie reveals the Fireflies have established a secret camp out west with doctors working on a vaccine to prevent infection, and her DNA may be key to ensuring success. Joel demands they return to the quarantine zone but Tess, still skeptical of Ellie's immunity, convinces him to follow through with their arrangement as the Fireflies will still give them supplies.
    <br><br> As the group makes its way towards the Massachusetts State House, Tess discovers a pack of infected blocking their route, explaining to Ellie the fungi can sense uninfected humans across long distances and draw its hosts towards them. Tess suggests going through a museum. A roof cave-in attracts two "clickers", mutated hosts who rely on sound to move. Ellie gets bitten and Joel and Tess kill the clickers. Arriving at the State House, they find the Fireflies dead; Joel finds evidence of infection and surmises they killed each other. Tess tries to find clues on where to go next, but Joel tells her the job is finished and they will return home. Tess tells him that she cannot go back, revealing a bite mark on her neck. She reveals Ellie's mark has already healed, proving her immunity.
    <br><br> Joel shoots an infected Firefly who tries to attack them, revealing their location to other infected hosts in the city. Tess tells Joel to take Ellie to fellow smugglers Bill and Frank. She covers the room with gasoline and grenades as Joel and Ellie leave. An infected man begins the process of converting Tess when she ignites the building, killing the creatures. Joel and Ellie watch as the State House explodes before Joel walks away.

  <h2> The Last of Us - Ep.3 "Long, Long Time" </h2>
  <p>
    Traveling on foot to Lincoln, Massachusetts, Joel (Pedro Pascal) searches for his stashed provisions while Ellie (Bella Ramsey) enters the basement and stabs a trapped infected to death. Encountering a pile of human skeletons, Joel explains the military culled some survivors to conserve food and living space.
    <br><br> Twenty years earlier, in Lincoln, Bill (Nick Offerman) monitors the evacuation from an underground bunker after the outbreak. He ransacks abandoned businesses for supplies and materials to build a generator, electric fence, and traps. Four years later, he encounters Frank (Murray Bartlett), who bargains for a hot meal, shower, and fresh clothes. He and Bill play "Long, Long Time" on the piano. He deduces Bill has never had a romantic partner. Frank kisses him, and they sleep together. Three years later, Frank invites Tess (Anna Torv) and Joel to establish a smuggling operation. Joel convinces the misanthropic Bill to accept Frank's plan by pointing out deficiencies in the town's defenses they can help fix. Later, raiders attempt to infiltrate the town, injuring Bill before being repelled by his defenses.
    <br><br> Ten years later, Bill and Frank are elderly, with a degenerative disease leaving Frank with limited mobility; he asks Bill to help him die. Bill takes Frank to dress in new suits and they marry in their living room. After dinner, Bill places a lethal dose of sleeping tablets in Frank's wine and reveals he spiked his own drink as well, admitting he has no desire to live without Frank. They retire to their room.
    <br><br> Several weeks later, Joel and Ellie reach Lincoln. Ellie finds a letter from Bill addressed to Joel, leaving him his truck, weapons, and any supplies he needs. Bill describes how caring for and protecting Frank gave him a purpose, and states both he and Joel have a mission to save and protect the worthy. When Joel discovers Bill was referring to Tess, he becomes emotional. He and Ellie agree to take Bill's truck and travel to Wyoming to find Tommy, who may be able to help transport Ellie to the Fireflies. Joel sets new rules for Ellie: neither of them is to address Tess or their histories; Ellie is to keep her condition a secret; and she has to follow Joel's orders. They stockpile from Bill's stash; unbeknownst to Joel, Ellie finds a gun and hides it in her backpack. The two drive away with Ronstadt's song playing on cassette.
